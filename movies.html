    <p><i>The greater the spy the bigger the lie? This movie's advertising is the biggest lie of all </i></p>
    <hr>

    <p>Argylle is a spy thriller movie that takes place in the Kingsverse, with other titles such as Kingsmen and the Kingsman. It features Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as the main characters with Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara as the main antagonists, as well as small guest appearances by Samauel L Jackson and Dua Lipa.</p>
    <p>...It also has about 5 mins of Henry Cavill and John Cena, even though they were the only reasons I saw the movie, and were made out in the trailer as key characters. Also look at the poster. Henry Cavill is at the very front, despite barely being in it, and has higher billing over both of the main characters... criminal behaviour</p>
    <p>Regardless, the movie was fine, although a bit long, and had some good plot twists paired with some very predictable plot twists. The dude I was sitting next to fell asleep midway through the movie, which was probably the funniest thing that happened all night. This movie is supposed to be part comedy btw</p>
    <p>Bryan Cranston in the only actor in this movie who can actually act, and Samauel Jackson needs to stop getting involved in these trash movies like this and The Marvels </p>
    <p>Finally, Flynn said this was <i>'the worst movie he had ever seen in theaters'</i>, which is a crazy take because we've seen The Marvels and the FNAF movie. THOSE movies are bad </p>
    <br>
    <p>All in all, This movie isn't great but if you have nothing else to do it's worth watching . It's not THAAAAT bad </p>
    <h4>RATING: 3/10</h4>

    <h2>2. The Beekeeper</h4>

      <p><i>To bee or not to bee </i></p>
      <hr>

      <p>This movie is awesome</p>
      <p>Beekeeper is a John Wick ripoff featuring Jason Statham, but basically instead of his dog dying his beehives are destroyed. After this random old lady gets scammed, 'Mr. Clay' decides to he has to <i> something something</i> <b>protect the hive</b> <i> something something</i> <b>smoke out the hornets</b> and kill a bunch of people idk doesn't matter   </p>
      <p>After a lengthy introductory scene of Jason Statham making honey and taking care of bees and shit, the rest of the movie is a non-stop action setpiece of 'The Beekeeper' mowing down hundreds of goons and blowing shit up. When I thought the movie was nearly over and the story was starting to wrap up, it just kept going forever and forever. Despite being only 1hr 45 mins long, it felt about 4 </p>
      <p>Especially noteworthy about this movie is the great visual effects, which are rare in recent times: <i>see above - Argylle</i>. Some swat dude gets cut in half by a steel wire, Statham ties up a goon to a car and drives it off a bridge, good fun. It definitely earns it's MA15+ rating</p>
      <p>To conclude, I loved this movie when it was called transporter, I loved this move when it was called The Expendables, SAFE, etc etc. A must watch.</p>

      <h2>3. Deadpool & Wolverine</h4>

        <p>Deadpool and Wolverine has quip-machine Ryan Reynolds team up with angry-but-deep-down-he’s-a-good-guy Hugh Jackman. It’s just another marvel movie except that characters are allowed to say naughty no-no words, and bad guys are hit in the balls instead of the head, which is met with barrels of laughs from the audience.</p>
        <p>To start with the positives, Hugh Jackman’s performance is really good. There are some great songs(NSYNC) and the CGI is a big step up from what Marvel has been dishing out recently.</p>
        <p>That aside, there are lots of negatives that bring this movie down. There wasn’t really any actual jokes, just kinda references and cameos like ‘Gamble’ and ‘Sabretooth’. It’s not really funny per-say, but reminiscent of that feeling you get when you see that obscure game or show you like gets mentioned. It’s cool and all, but when that’s all you have for a 2hr it’s gets old fast.</p>
        <p>Additionally, despite Ryan Reynolds mocking Disney throughout the movie, the plot has the same cookie cutter formula you’d come to expect from their movies. Deadpool learns the real treasure is the friends he made along the way, and only through the power of friendship can stop the world-ending random do-hickey be stopped. It’s basically Wolverine and Deadpool mowing down mooks for 2 hours, (without the stakes as they’re both immortal) while Disney constantly remind the audience that they now have the rights to Fantastic 4 and X-Men </p>
        <p>Finally, the villains have been downgraded from Hela and Thanos to girl Charles Xavier (with legs) and a random middle management guy, both of which were no match for the power of friendship. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, it’s watchable but I wouldn’t really recommend it</p>
        <h4>RATING: 5/10</h4>
