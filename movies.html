    <p><i>The greater the spy the bigger the lie? This movie's advertising is the biggest lie of all </i></p>
    <hr>

    <p>Argylle is a spy thriller movie that takes place in the Kingsverse, with other titles such as Kingsmen and the Kingsman. It features Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as the main characters with Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara as the main antagonists, as well as small guest appearances by Samauel L Jackson and Dua Lipa.</p>
    <p>...It also has about 5 mins of Henry Cavill and John Cena, even though they were the only reasons I saw the movie, and were made out in the trailer as key characters. Also look at the poster. Henry Cavill is at the very front, despite barely being in it, and has higher billing over both of the main characters... criminal behaviour</p>
    <p>Regardless, the movie was fine, although a bit long, and had some good plot twists paired with some very predictable plot twists. The dude I was sitting next to fell asleep midway through the movie, which was probably the funniest thing that happened all night. This movie is supposed to be part comedy btw</p>
    <p>Bryan Cranston in the only actor in this movie who can actually act, and Samauel Jackson needs to stop getting involved in these trash movies like this and The Marvels </p>
    <p>Finally, Flynn said this was <i>'the worst movie he had ever seen in theaters'</i>, which is a crazy take because we've seen The Marvels and the FNAF movie. THOSE movies are bad </p>
    <br>
    <p>All in all, This movie isn't great but it's worth watching if it's available. It's not THAAAAT bad </p>
    <h4>RATING: 6/10</h4>
